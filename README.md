The aim of this codeðŸŽ¯ is to describe my process for the establishment of Zettelkasten method within Visual Studio Code using git and a few PowerShell scripts for:

* page creator 
* link updater
* link creator

* The important difference to the usual Zettelkasten method is the implementation of dynamic linking.
     - Links are just filenames with timestamps - both of which I can modify easily
     - They bear an important semantic layer for me - when am I worknig on it and what is it. 
     - I can then search easily. 
     - I can re-link during re-naming
